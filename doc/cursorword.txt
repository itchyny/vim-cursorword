INTRODUCTION					*cursorword-introduction*
This *cursorword* plugin underlines the word under the cursor. That's it.

While we are coding, we always pay attention to the variable under the cursor.
Where did we define the variable? In which statement do we use the variable?
Searching the variable using |star| or |#| is a simple solution to highlight all
the places the variable is used. However, it costs too much time to highlight
a word, move around to check the places and clear the highlight.  This plugin
|cursorword| provides you the modest underlines for the variables under the
cursor to let you know all the places the variable is used at a glance without
stopping coding.

The brightest plugin (https://github.com/osyo-manga/vim-brightest) is a nice
plugin to fulfill highlights of the word under the cursor. However, it uses
too long codes and is too slow. I had been using the plugin for a while but I
could not bear the slowness caused by brightest on the cursor motions. This is
why I created |cursorword|. I think that a plugin which is running all the time
should be coded with the performance efficiency in mind. When we publish a
plugin which stays running in all buffers, we should be aware that it will use
much resource of all the users.

The code of |cursorword| is very tiny. It's very tiny that |cursorword| runs ten
times faster than brightest. Instead of its efficiency, |cursorword| is totally
unconfigurable. But you will find this plugin just comfortable; the modest
underlines are enough for us. A good configurable plugin would have many
options that users can configure almost all the features. But be relaxed and
imagine, do we need such a lot of options for a plugin to highlight the word
under the cursor? Most people would never need such a lot of options. We
should not implement features for a few power users at the sacrifice of the
performance of the software. Keep your software small for the happiness of
most users. Too much configurability makes your software dirty and causes
unwanted slowness on many users. We have to rethink what good configurability
is and for what kind of software such configurability is required.
